We also integrated a line of best fit to properly model the data, as well as acquire specific values for disease interpretation, such as transmission rate, and many others, so that we can make accurate conclusions on the data.\n\n\n\n## What do you notice about the initial infections?\nThe initial infections start off low, as expected. There aren't many infections, and the rate at which the infections are growing across the population is also low compared to later. Overall, it is typical of an emerging outbreak, with just a few infections and several extra getting infected over time, giving us an idea of how this disease is manifesting over time.\n\n## How could we measure how quickly it's spreading?\nWe can measure how quickly it is spreading by acquiring a line of best fit and reading the slope of that. To get more specific, we can take intervals, such as the weekly intervals offered by the data, calculate the rate of growth in infections over all those weeks, and then average those too. These two methods will give you a solid estimate, that is relatively, but not fully, representative of the growth rate of the infection. If we want a recent estimate for how quickly it is spreading, we can just take the slope over the most recent week of data and model it from there.\n\n## What information about the virus would be helpful in determining the shape of the outbreak curve?\nI'd say that we should clean up the two discrepancies that come with this data before improving the information. If there were means to see any physiological signal changes for people who end up in that 2 day pre-symptomatic window, we can apply the same formula of Beta onto them to get an average sense of how many people they're affecting, giving us a more accurate view of how many are infected, and how many will be in the future. Secondly, if we can remove the reporting delays, ideally through computer automation of data retrieval and parsing, we can get more accurate numbers, allowing us to see more idealized, and personalized, interventions, and not misrepresenting treatments.  \n",

We used the slope of the line of best fit as our best estimate of an average transmission rate over time, as it did signal a positive slope and proper growth over the graph. We then divided the same slope by 7 and did another calculation where we divided that slope by 11. We then took the average of those 2 to get our R0 estimate.\n\n## What viruses have a similar R0? \n*Use the viruses.html file to find a virus or 2 with a similar R0 and give a 1-2 sentence background of the diseases.*\nNipah, Hendra, and Hantavirus are the 3 viruses to which we have the closest R0 to, even though our R0 doesn't match with them. \n\n### Nipah\n\nNipah virus is a zoonotic virus that is usually transmitted by bats, causing severe neurological issues such as seizures and headaches whilst also bringing along fever and cough, leading to high fatality rates in some South Asian to Southeast Asian countries such as India, Malaysia, and Singapore.\n\n### Hendra\n\nHendra virus is another zoonotic virus largely connected to horses and 7 human cases, mainly in Australia. It usually starts with flu-like symptoms, slowly progressing to severe respiratory and neurological symptoms, concurring a high fatality rate.\n\n## How accurate do you think your R0 estimate is?\nI don't think our R0 estimate was very accurate. There may have been an issue with our calculations or with the way we may have interpreted some of the data points. ",
